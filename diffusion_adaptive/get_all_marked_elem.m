function [MMele,MMedge] = get_all_marked_elem(Ybasis,evtY,Mset,imark)
%GET_ALL_MARKED_ELEM recovers the overall set of marked elements/edges (avoiding hanging nodes)
%
% [MMele,MMedge] = get_all_marked_elem(Ybasis,evtY,Mset,imark)
%
% input:
%      Ybasis   Y-basis element-positions matrix
%        evtY   element mapping matrix for midpoints
%        Mset   vector of marked objects, either elements or edges
%       imark   1 or 2 if Mset is a vector of elements or edges, respectively
%
% output:
%       MMele   vector of overall marked elements (hanging nodes avoided)
%      MMedge   vector of overall marked edges    (hanging nodes avoided)
%
% Given in input either the set of marked elements or edges, the function 
% returns both the sets of *overall* marked elements and edges such that 
% the refinement does not produce any hanging node. 
%
% NOTE that *no mesh* refinement is performed here!
%
% NOTE that the function has to be called as:
% - [MMele,MMedge] = get_all_marked_elem(Ybasis,evtY,Mele,1), 
%   if Mele is the set of marked elements;
%
% - [MMele,MMedge] = get_all_marked_elem(Ybasis,evtY,Medge,2),
%   if Medge is the set of marked edges;
%
% The function works according to the following procedure:
%
% (1) Recover the elements (neighbours) sharing (the midpoints of) the longest 
%     edges of the marked elements Mele: -> Ybasis( evtY(Mele,2) ,[1,2]);
%
% (2) If this set is exactly Mele, it means that no hanging nodes will be
%     produced and no further elements need to be marked. In particular, 
%     this happens if Mele consists of elements sharing only the longest edge;
%
% (3) Otherwise, there is some edge's midpoint belonging to an element
%     which has not been marked. Hence, that midpoint will be an hanging node. 
%     In this case, we add the associated element to the vector of marked 
%     elements.
%
% The procedure continues until condition (2) is satisfied.
