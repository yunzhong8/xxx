These notes are associated with the software release of T-IFISS.
This is a suite of m-files for solving steady diffusion problems in 
a general two-dimensional geometry using the finite element method.
Unstructured mesh generation is effected using the DISTMESH package.

The T-IFISS package has five main ingredients:
o  Discretisation with linear (P1) and quadratic (P2) elements 
o  Visualisation of the computed solution
o  Built-in a posteriori error estimation of the generated solution.
o  Self-adaptive solution driven by rigorous energy error estimation
o  Iterative solvers can be tested on the resulting linear systems
 
Major changes/additions in version 1.2:

.  choice of three types of error estimation strategies using piecewise 
   linear bubble functions for P1 approximations
   (element residual (default), global hierarchical, 2-level)
.  choice of edge- or element-based marking
   (for hierarchical and 2-level error estimation)
.  goal-oriented adaptivity with 6 different marking strategies
.  fast (vectorized) mesh refinement
